| Whereas medieval builders improvised and adapted construction through their intimate knowledge of materials and personal experience of the conditions on a site, building designs are now conceived and stored in media technologies that detach the designer from the physical and social realities they are creating. While the design practices created by these new technologies are essential for managing the technical complexity of the modern city, they have the drawback of simplifying reality in the process. | |

|First, implicit theories of intelligence drive the way in which people perceive and evaluate their own intelligence and that of others.| |
|These implicit theories can suggest what aspects of the phenomenon have been more or less attended to in previous investigations. | |
|Finally, understanding implicit theories of intelligence can help elucidate developmental and cross-cultural differences.| |
|The Jacksonian view is that all people are equal, not only as human beings but in terms of their competencies - that one person would serve as well as another in government or on a jury or in almost any position of responsibility. In this view of democracy, people are essentially intersubstitutable except for specialized skills, all of which can be learned. In this view, we do not need or want any institutions that might lead to favoring one group over another. | |
|Implicit theories of intelligence and of the relationship of intelligence to society perhaps need to be considered more carefully than they have been because they often serve as underlying presuppositions for explicit theories and even experimental designs that are then taken as scientific contributions. Until scholars are able to discuss their implicit theories and thus their assumptions, they are likely to miss the point of what others are saying when discussing their explicit theories and their data.| |

|Looking to nature for the soothing and curing of our ailments is nothing new - we have been doing it for tens of thousands of years | |

|As global temperatures continue to rise, we are going to continue to squander more and more energy on keeping our buildings mechanically cool until we have run out of capacity | |
|Short is calling for a sweeping reinvention of how skyscrapers and major public buildings are designed - to end the reliance on sealed buildings which exist solely via the 'life support' system of vast air conditioning units.| | 
|Instead, he shows it is entirely possible to accommodate natural ventilation and cooling in large buildings by looking into the past, before the widespread introduction of air conditioning systems, which were 'relentlessly and aggressively marketed' by their inventors. | |
|Short regards glass, steel and air-conditioned skyscrapers as symbols of status, rather than practical ways of meeting our requirements. | |
|Professor Short contends the mindset and skill-sets behind these designs have been completely lost, lamenting the disappearance of expertly designed theatres, opera houses and other buildings where up to half the volume of the building was given over to ensuring everyone got fresh air. | |

|It is difficult to conceive of vigorous economic growth without an efficient transport system | |
|For passenger transport, the determining factor is the spectacular growth in car use| |
|However, a new imperative - sustainable development - offers an opportunity for adapting the EU's common transport policy | |
|This objective, agreed by the European Council, has to be achieved by integrating environmental considerations into Community policies, and shifting the balance between modes of transport lies at the heart of its strategy.| |
|Once again, road transport is the main culprit since it alone accounts for 84% of the CO2 emissions attributable to transport  | |
|Using alternative fuels and improving energy efficiency is thus both an ecological necessity and a technological challenge.| |
|However, the lack of measures available to revitalise other modes of transport would make it impossible for more sustainable modes of transport to take up the baton. | |
|The third approach, which is not new, comprises a series of measures ranging from pricing to revitalising alternative modes of transport and targeting investment in the trans-European network| |
|Studies show that we invariably take more gambles when threatened with a loss than when offered a reward.| |
